## Dragon Trials

The Dragon Trials are an evolved form of the gauntlet, with the key differences being :

- The top 3 teams of the previous season build rounds 1-3 (staff still builds round 4)
- The Kais will face all 4 rounds, regardless of winning or losing.

Prior to the Dragon Trials, the bronze medal winner of the previous season will build round 1,
the runner up will build round 2, and the Tenkaichi bowl winner will build round 3.

The following document gives a general overview and outlines the rules for selectable Dragon Trial Teams :

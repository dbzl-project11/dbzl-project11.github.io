## Gauntlet

The Gauntlet is one the major league events each season. It involves Division teams fighting off against the very toughest 
opponents Budokai Tenkaichi 3 has to offer.  Each round is progressively more difficult, with the 4th round being an "anything goes" 
level of difficulty. The challenge comes from the fact that the teams built by league participants will have restrictions
near to the level of the main league.  The only advantage the league teams get is that for rounds 1-3, they will know the builds in advance.
Round 4 builds will always be kept a mystery unless a team reaches the 4th round.

Note that Free Agents are not allowed to participate in this event.
   
### Gauntlet specific build rules 

- The teams built will be 5 character teams.
- The build point limit is increased to 8 points. Limiters in use during the season also carryover.
- if desired, the gauntlet teams may designate one character to "Shatter the Limit". 
    - This means that any/all restrictions normally on them are removed. 
        - For example, that character may use any form (GT Goku starting in SSJ4), Potara (such as using EL if Cell 
        starts in base form), etc. they wish. 
    - However, that character's build is limited to 5 pts and the potaras they use may not be used on any other member of the team. 

-  The following potaras are now allowed for the gauntlet only:
    - Water Blessing (4) - The effects of EL, and High Tension while underwater (Normally 1 pt, counts as 4pts, max 1 per team, does not count to EL limit)
    - Satisfying Blow (3) - Your Supers ignore the effects of brick walls, and you get Ki -1 (Normally 1 pt, counts as 3 pts, max 1 per team)
    - Master Roshi's Training (2) - Gain 10k max HP (Max 1 per team)
    - 18's kiss (5) - Gain dragon homing and vanishing attack +2 (Normally 7 pts, counts as 5 pts)
    - Medical Machine (7) - The effects of EL, KSA, and High Tension. (Max 1 per team, does not count to EL limit)

- Note that Eternal Life and B1 potara bans carryover here. So a character banned from Eternal Life may not use Water Blessing or
Medical Machine. Similarly, a character banned from Kibito's Secret Art may not use Medical Machine.
    - However, you can use the Shatter the limit build to bypass these restrictions. In the case of Medical Machine, this will be the 
    entirety of your build. As of now, only Medical Machine can be used in this way.

### Creating the league's teams

To create the team, one character from each of the four teams in a division are chosen, along with a second character 
from any of the teams, creating a five-player team for each division. However, rather than have a team decide on their 
own Gauntlet character, the other teams in their division will decide for them. 

For example, in a Kai comprised of the Earth Defenders, Cold Kingdom, Buujins and Androids, Cold Kingdom would have NO SAY 
in who goes from their team to the Gauntlet. The Earth's Defenders, Androids and Buujins will decide. Once those teams have 
decided, then all four teams can collaborate on that players build. 

The fifth member can be chosen in collaboration by all 4 teams.

    - Eternal Life has one use, but Savior could be used twice.

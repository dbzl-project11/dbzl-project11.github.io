## AI Potaras

AI potaras are the brain of your player. It tells the player how to fight and what moves to use more often. Keep in mind that AI potaras work differently for each character and the only real way to see how it will affect your character is to test it. 

Here is a list of each AI potara as defined by the game:

- Attack Oriented AIs.

    - Trunks:  Emphasizes Rush Attack and other high-speed attacks.

    - Tien:  Emphasizes close-range Rush and Ultimate Blast.

    - Majin Buu:  Emphasizes barrage attacks and combos.

    - Broly:  Emphasizes doggedly pursuing and attacking the opponent.

    - Recoome:  Emphasizes getting in close to use Throw attacks.

- Defense Oriented AIs

    - Piccolo:  Concentrates on putting up a consistent defense and exploiting opponent's openings. (Silly Flavor Text)

    - Chiaotzu:  Makes irregular movements and uses many Blast 1 attacks.

    - Yajirobe:  Fights by evading the opponent, using Ki, and refilling the Blast Gauge. (WUT)

    - Ginyu:  Emphasizes using Blast 1 and other techniques to boost strength.


- Balanced AIs
    - Goku: Emphasizes close combat.

    - Vegeta: Emphasizes using energy blasts from a distance.

    - Gohan: Becomes offensive while in MAX POWER Mode. (I like the caps)

    - Krillin: Emphasizes energy blasts, Blast 2, and other attacks that use Ki.

    - Frieza: Fights based on emphasizing Blasts.

    - Cell: Emphasizes attacking from dashing and then moving away; a "hit and run" strategy.

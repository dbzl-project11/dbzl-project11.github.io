## Rules

The following rules are mandatory. Failing to follow them will result in that team incurring a
warning/penalty depending on the severity and frequency of the offense.

For minor offenses a warning will be incurred. If a team commits 3 minor offenses they will be
penalized and not receive zeni for the week on which they incurred the third offense.

For major offenses the team will be penalized immediately and will not receive zeni for the week
of the offense.

Make sure to include all parts from the template below when posting builds. Build postings do not
have to look identical to the template, they just simply need to include the same parts. Use the
template below as a guideline for what is required.

Do not abbreviate or create acronyms of potara names. While some are fairly well known, it still
causes issues with builders. Please write them in your builds as they are written in the potara
thread.

If you have a character that starts in a form other than base (eg: SSJs, Muscle Roshi, Third Form
Frieza) please make sure to mention it with the character.

Place the potara cost after the potara name. Not only does this help you keep track of how many
points you are using, but it also serves as a quick way the people doing set up can check over
things to make sure all of the costs add up right.

FA Benched characters must be specified on FA Swap weeks.

If you are using the same build from one week to the next, please keep the potara order the same.
When builds are set up we like to do them in the order that they appear in your builds. This cuts
down on mistakes and makes it easier to double check the builds. That means, if you change the
order of your potaras from one week to the next we might have to re-do the entire build to account
for it. Not only does this cause a headache for the people setting up builds, but it also makes
build checking take longer. NOTE -- This is a staff preference. You will not get penalized for not
following this.

DO NOT edit your teams builds after the deadline has passed. Regardless of what the edit was,
the builds will be considered invalid since we have no way of confirming what the unedited
builds were.

As a note, when specifying a characters AI potara if no potara is written down on a build, then it will
be assumed that the character is using Default AI (no AI potara in the game).

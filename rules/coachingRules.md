# Coach Rules

Note to team-members: if you believe your coach isn’t abiding by these rules, then take your concerns PRIVATELY either to the coach themselves or to the Staff. Do NOT make them public.

1) Coaching is a season to season position. You will be asked if you wish to continue at the end of each season. 

2) Coaches are responsible for communicating team decisions to staff and the rest of the community. However, all decisions are made democratically.

3) When team decisions are tied (including the coaches' vote), coaches will decide how to break the tie. But effort must be made to show discussion and compromise with all team members.

4) Coaches are to be the leader of conversations and are expected to start conversations when supporters are quiet or unsure about what to do. 

5) Coaches are expected to spend about 3-5 hours per week to coordinate builds, tests, and discussions. This may vary by team needs.

Failure to abide by these can result in a coach being removed by staff decision. 

Other notes:

If you are inactive for more than 2 weeks from Pre-season week 1 to the end of your team's season without notice, then you will be removed from the position of coach.

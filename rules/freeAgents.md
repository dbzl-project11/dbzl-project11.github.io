## Free Agents

Free Agents are characters in BT3 that can be on teams, but are not required to fit the team theme. The intention was that
these characters could be used to cover for a weak character on a team with a limited theme. 

At this time, the characters guaranteed to be Free Agents are: 

- Adult Gohan
- General Blue 
- General Tao
- Grandpa Gohan
- Pikkon
- Tapion
- Vegito (base form)

There are, of course, other characters available as Free Agents, but aren't guaranteed to be such. A final list of available
Free Agents will be produced each season after the team drop/add window has completed. Starting with the 2021 season, 
staff may add additional FAs to the pool using unused forms of charcters with multiple transformations.

Other available FAs (as of the time this was posted) include the following:


- Appule
- Babidi
- Chi-Chi
- Chiaotzu
- Cui
- Dodoria
- Frieza Soldier
- Guldo
- Janemba
- Spopovich
- Yajirobe
- Zarbon

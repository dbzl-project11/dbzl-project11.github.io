## Free Agents

Free Agents (FA) are characters in BT3 that can be on teams, but are not required to fit the team theme. The intention was that
these characters could be used to cover for a weak character on a team with a limited theme. 

At this time, the characters guaranteed to be Free Agents are: 

- Adult Gohan (may start any form)
- Android 21
- General Tao
- Grandpa Gohan
- Pikkon
- Tapion
- Vegito (base form)


During the main season, this character will act as a reserve character for your team, and 3 times a season (weeks 1, 6, and 11)
you may choose to swap out your FA for any character on your team. If you wish to swap out on a more frequent basis, you may 
purchase the relevant boost in the [boost store](../usefulInfo/boost.md).

During the pre-season and post-season, teams may switch between their FA and other characters on their team at their discretion on a weekly basis.

When benching your FA, the FA will be treated as if benched on the same schedule as the character being replaced. The only caveat is that no character may be in more than 12 weeks of the main season under any circumstance.

Example: if Budokai benched Kid Goku weeks 1 and 4 during the main season, and then chooses to swap in Pikkon for Kid Goku, 
Pikkon will be treated as if he had been benched weeks 1 and 4.


There are, of course, other characters available as Free Agents, but aren't guaranteed to be such. A final list of available
Free Agents will be produced each season after the team drop/add window has completed. Starting with the 2021 season, 
staff may add additional FAs to the pool using unused forms of charcters with multiple transformations.

All available FAs for the 2022 season:

- 10 zeni:
    - Appule
    - Chi-Chi
    - Devilman
    - General Blue
    - Grandpa Gohan

    - Tapion

"*" indicates that character must have a Broly's Ring. 

Note that Cold may not have 1st Form Frieza and Final Form Frieza in the same lineup. 

If Cold picks up 1st Form Frieza as a free agent, 1st Form Frieza could *only* sub in for Final Form Frieza.

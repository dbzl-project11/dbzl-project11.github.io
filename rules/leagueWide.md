## League-wide Rules

- Any team with a healing grab rotated in that week is banned from Eternal Life
    - Characters with these moves include:
        - Cell (Base, Semi-Perfect forms)

- Teams with 2 or more healing transformations are banned as a team from Eternal life. 
For teams with only 1 healing transformation, only the character with the transformation is banned from Eternal Life
    - Teams currently impacted:    
        - Androids (Cell)
        - Cold Kingdom (Frieza and Cooler)
        
- Super Saiyan in general may not start above SSJ1, but this is handled on a case by case basis. These characters may start above SSJ1.
    - GT Goku (He may start in any form from SSJ3 and below), 
    - SS4 Vegeta (since this is his only form)
    - End Vegeta (may start in any form)

- Any character with a giant form (That has a permanent brick wall) may not start in that giant form. There are no exceptions.

- Any character with a cutscene ultimate may not have "Savior" in their starting form. This refers to any unblockable ultimate that connects if *any* part of the blast hits you. The rule currently applies only to the following characters: 
    - End Goku (Base)
    - Goten (SSJ1)
    - Adult Gohan (SSJ1)

- Forms of characters are not considered to be separate characters. The exceptions are: 
    - Adult Gohan/Saiyaman. 
        - They have also been modded to be unable to transform into the other.
    - Videl/Saiyawoman 
        - They have also been modded to be unable to transform into the other.

- Characters with strong rush blast (RB) volleys may have some level of restriction from Master Blast and Rush Blast 2. 
    - The first level of restriction bans the combination of Attack+ blue potaras and Master Blast/Rush Blast 2. This is referred to as a partial ban.
    - The second level of restriction bans the character entirely.
    
- The characters who have some level of restriction have these stats related to their rush blasts:

|Single RB Damage | # of RBs in a volley |   
| :-------------| :---------------------|
| 320 | 10| 
| 340 | 9-10| 
| 360 | 8-9| 
| 380 | 7-8| 
| 400 | 6-7| 
| 420 | 5-6| 
| 440 | 4-5| 
| 460 | 3-4|

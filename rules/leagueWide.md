        - They have also been modded to be unable to transform into the other.

- We do not allow for private testing by our supporters (but if you wish, you can become an authorized tester). If you need information for league purposes,
it must come from official league sources.

        - this website
        - the Discord
        - the Youtube channels (the main channel and testing channel)
        - the player calculator
        - asking staff members.
    - If you have the base Tenkaichi 3 game, we hope you enjoy playing it, just don't try to get information about the AI.

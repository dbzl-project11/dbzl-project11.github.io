## League-wide Rules

- Any team with a healing grab rotated in that week is banned from Eternal Life
    - Characters with these moves include:
        - Cell (Base, Semi-Perfect forms)

- Teams with 2 or more healing transformations are banned as a team from Eternal life. 
For teams with only 1 healing transformation, only the character with the transformation is banned from Eternal Life
    - Teams currently impacted:    
        - Androids (Cell)
        - Cold Kingdom (Frieza and Cooler)
        
- Which Super Saiyan a character may start in is handled on a case by case basis. These characters may start above SSJ1.
    - GT Goku (He may start in any form from SSJ3 and below), 
    - SS4 Vegeta (since this is his only form)
    - Adult Gohan


- For contestable characters, there is a  6 test minimum that a team must complete before they can pick up a character. Note this only applies to characters who were available for pickup
from the start of the off season. 
  - Example: Budokai must have a minimum of 6 tests before they can pick up Videl or Roshi if they were not on a team the previous season.

  - Example where this does not apply: If Androids drops Super 17 during drop/add, GT does NOT need to do 6 tests before trying to pick him up.


- Any character with a giant form (That has a permanent brick wall) may not start in that giant form. There are no exceptions.

- Any character with a cutscene ultimate may not have "Savior" in their starting form. This refers to any unblockable ultimate that connects if *any* part of the blast hits you. The rule currently applies only to the following characters: 
    - End Goku (Base)
    - Goten (SSJ1)
    - Adult Gohan (SSJ1)

- Forms of characters are not considered to be separate characters. The exceptions below have also been modded to allow them to be in the same lineup : 
    - Adult Gohan/Saiyaman. 
        - They have also been modded to be unable to transform into the other.
    - Videl/Saiyawoman 
        - They have also been modded to be unable to transform into the other.

- Characters with strong rush blast (RB) volleys may have some level of restriction from Master Blast and Rush Blast 2. 
    - The first level of restriction bans the combination of Attack+ blue potaras and Master Blast/Rush Blast 2. This is referred to as a partial ban.
    - The second level of restriction bans the character entirely.
    
- The characters who have some level of restriction have these stats related to their rush blasts:

| Single RB Damage | # of RBs in a volley |   
|:-----------------|:---------------------|
| 320              | 10                   | 
| 340              | 9-10                 | 
| 360              | 8-9                  | 
| 380              | 7-8                  | 
| 400              | 6-7                  | 
| 420              | 5-6                  | 
| 440              | 4-5                  | 
| 460              | 3-4                  |

- We do not allow for private testing by our supporters when it comes to gleaning data about the AI (but if you wish, you can become an authorized tester).
  - If you can't get the data from the base game directly, you can check these sources:
      - this website
      - the Discord
      - the Youtube channels (the main channel and testing channel)
      - the player calculator
      - asking staff members.
  - If you have to get the data from the game, we ask the following
    - Don't try to glean AI data if testing on your own.
    - Let a staff member know before starting. This just helps us stay in the loop.
    - Please help the community as a whole by sharing your work, and if possible showing it. This way everyone benefits.

## Potaras

So here is the deal, every player has 7 points with which to customize. Below is a list of abilities and an explanation of what they do. They are grouped by how many points they cost. Look over them and start debating with your team how to best use them. If you have any question about what something does, by all means ask, and we will do our best to help.

#### 1 Point Blue Potaras 

- Attack +1 – Raises all non-super damage by 13%. Including Throws, Rush Blasts, B1 damage, anything that isn’t a B2 or an Ultimate. (Limited to 1 per team)

- Defense +1 – You take 5% less damage from any attack. (Limited to 1 per team)

- Defense +2 Attack -1 – You take 10% less damage from any attack, but lowers all non-super damage by 6.5%. (Limited to 1 per team)

- Ki +1 – Your Ki charge rate is increased by 20%. Generally more suited towards active chargers (Non-androids). (Limited to 1 per team)

- Super +1 – Increases the amount of damage your Super moves will deal by 13%. (Limited to 1 per team)

#### 2-Point Blue Potaras

- Defense +2 – You take 10% less damage from any attack. (Limited to 1 per team)

- Defense +3 Attack -1 – You take 15% less damage from any attack, but you deal 13% less damage with your non-super moves. * (Limited to 1 per team)

Please note, to keep Defense in-line with the other potaras, you may only use 2 Defense potaras (whether 1 pt or 2 pts). 

#### 1-Point Yellow Potaras —

- Active Heart – Rate of Ki recovery after a Rush Attack hits is increased slightly. 

- Every time you hit someone with hand to hand combos, you naturally gain a bit of Ki. This roughly doubles the amount of Ki generated from rush attacks. Each character generates a different amount of Ki, so this could work better for some characters over others.

- Aura Charge (Color) – Player aura becomes (Color) Receive an extra gauge of Ki at the start of each battle. (May only use 1 per member.)

Auras are the color of the energy surrounding a character. This is mostly cosmetic, because the actual combat bonuses are very small in comparison to most other potaras.

Available colors are:

    Blue
    Purple
    Yellow
    Red
    Green
    White
    Pink
    Violet
    Ultimate – The normal aura of a Super Saiyan
    Ultimate 3 – The normal aura of a Super Saiyan 3
    Ultimate 4 – The normal aura of a Super Saiyan 4

- Battle Control – Switch Gauge recovers twice as fast.

- Broly’s Ring – Cannot transform during battle. 

- Charged Attack – You deal 13% more damage with Smash Attacks, but you deal 13% less damage with Rush Attacks. 

- Combo Master – Remove the “Combo Limiter” while not in Max Power Mode.

Remove the “Combo Limiter” (Normally, after 7 hits, every hit deals 5% less damage up to a cap of 80% less damage. Please note that the combo limiter does not happen while in Max Power Mode, but will start when Max Power ends. For instance, if a character does a 150 hit combo in max power mode, he will do 100% damage throughout the combo. But if Max power mode ends, and they hit 1 more time, then the Combo Limiter will start and the 151st hit will only deal 95% of the usual damage. Generally only useful on characters who routinely raise the combo limiter to above 7 hits in melee. Chiaotzu, and Burter are good examples of these types of characters.

- Exquisite Skill – Stun/restraint effects inflicted on you wear off 50% faster. Stun/restraint effects that you inflict on your opponents lasts 50% longer. 

- This includes blast 1 stun moves like Solar Flare, Kaikosen, and some Energy Blasts that stun the opponent, like Babidi’s.

- Fighting Spirit! – Gain Ki +.5 per bar of HP lost. 

This boosts your charge rate by moves by 10% per bar of health lost. This stat increase stacks with blue potaras, and scales based upon your maximum health.

- Flight – Fighters who cannot fly become able to do so. 

This is not vital as the player can still “fly” they just can’t levitate. They start to slowly sink. We ran test and it made no real difference, but it is up to you

- Hatred of Saiyans – Passively gain 1 bar of Ki every 60 seconds. A lesser version of Tension Up.

- High Spot – Rush Rapid Movement Ki use is halved, but Rush Attack and Smash Attack damage is reduced by 13%. 

This is talking about melee combat. A rush attack is a hand to hand combo. Rapid Rush movement is when you teleport around the opponent. For ex. they try to hit you and you disappear and re-appear behind them. The energy used when doing this would be half, but your hand to hand combos will do less damage.

- Indignation! – Gain Super +.5 per bar of HP lost.

This boosts the damage of all Super moves by 6.5%. This stat increase stacks with blue potaras, and scales based upon your maximum health.

- Latent Energy! – Gain Defense +.5 per bar of HP lost. 

This reduces all damage taken by 2.5% per bar of health lost. This stat increase stacks with blue potaras, and scales based upon your maximum health.

- Light Body – Cannot be stunned as easily by Rush Blasts. 

Please note, that Draconic Aura will negate this effect.

- Master Blast – Rush/Energy Blasts travel 2x faster, deal 50% more damage, and cost 50% less Ki. However, you deal 13% less damage with rush/smash attacks.

Please note, that this effect does not stack with “Rush Blast X” potaras.

- Master Strike – You deal 13% more damage with Rush/Smash Attacks. However, this also comes with the penalty of Super -2 (Supers deal 26% less damage), and halving the damage of your throws. 

Please note, that the damage bonus of this effect does not stack with the “Charged Attack”, and “Quick Fast Attack” potaras. However, the negative effects will apply to Master Strike. So you will end up having either Rush Attack +13%, or Smash Attack +13% instead of both Rush/Smash Attack +13%. Please do not try to stack these potaras.

- Master Throw – You deal 2x damage with throws. However, Rush/Energy Blasts deal 1/2 damage, costs 2x more, and produce 3 fewer shots per volley. 

- Mind Breaker – Ki damage caused when Guard Crushing opponent is increased. 

Guard crush is when you break their defense (it looks like glass is shattering) It forces them to lose KI and this will increase the Ki lost by 1 bar. Once a character loses all of their Ki through a guard crush, they are stunned until they naturally regenerate their base Ki power. Leaving them open for attack!

- Mirage – If you dodge a move that has multiple hits with Rapid Movement, you’ll automatically dodge the rest.

Can be very useful against moves like genocide blast that launches a lost of small blasts at once. For an example, this potara makes your character act as if they used Afterimage Strike as long as they dodge the first hit. Similar to that, the rest of the move will be dodged.

- Persistant Threat – Afterimage after you are knocked down. However, the blast gauge charges 25% slower. 

The conditions required for this potara to kick in fully are still a mystery, and could be related to being fully on the ground without trying to stand up. However, if it does proc, Afterimage automatically dodges an attack by teleporting behind the opponent.

- Proof of Friendship – Switch Gauge is at maximum at the start of each battle, but takes twice as long to charge.

Below the life bar is a purple “Switch” bar that must fill up before you can tag out.

- Quick Charge – Chargeable Supers charge 50% faster (some examples are Kamehameha, and Special Beam Cannon).

- Quick Fast Attack – You deal 13% more damage with Rush Attacks, but you deal 13% less damage with Smash Attacks. 

- Quick Return – Recover 50% faster when rendered unconscious. 

Unconscious here is where a character is stunned after having their guard broken, without having enough energy to defend against it.

- Rising Fighting Spirit – You start the battle with full ki. Generally only useful for starters. 

- Rush Blast (1) – Rush/Energy Blasts travel 50% faster. 

This refers to the small energy balls that can be rapidly fired. Please note, that this effect does not stack with other “Rush Blast X” potaras, or Master Blast.

- Savior – Automatically go into MAX POWER Mode when switching fighters in Team Battle. 

- Serious! – Gain Attack +.5 per bar of HP lost.

This boosts the damage of all Non-Super moves by 6.5%. This stat increase stacks with blue potaras, and scales based upon your maximum health.

- Super Senses – You lock on 50% faster (Characters with scouters already have this ability built in, so they are not effected by this potara). 

This may not seem important, but some character’s moves have the ability to make the opponent lose track of them. Including most Ultimates. The opponent must then spend time standing still and looking for the character. This can be bad for obvious reasons.

- Unleash Ki – Gain Clash +1. This grants a small boost to Clashes. 

Clashes refer to the high speed hand to hand combat struggles that occur when two opponents rush at each other. For the most part, Clashes are a mini-game of Rock – Paper – Scissors which heavily depends on how the AI acts, and if it has a tendency to do the inputs and win a clash. This potara helps to give a slight edge over other characters aren’t using a clash potara, but you can still definitely lose with this if the Ai doesn’t try to win.

Beam Struggles seem to also be effected by clash potaras, but it seems to have a much lesser effect than normal melee clashes and is more dependant on the Super type. Ultimates seem to have a higher chance to win a beam struggle as well.

- Warrior’s Will/Evil Pride – Damage taken while Guarding is halved. 

#### 2-Point Yellow Potaras 

- Dende’s Healing – Gradually recover health during combat. This happens no matter what the character does. 

Regenerate approximately 50 HP/second. Equates to 3,000 HP/minute

- Dragon Break – Dragon Homing +1 

Dragon homing is what happens when you knock an opponent away and immediately chase after them and knock them away again. Normally you can only do this once or twice depending on the character. This will let you chase after and hit them one more time.

- Dragon Heart – Regain a Blast Stock each time Rapid Movement is used to dodge a Blast 2 or an Ultimate Blast. However, your Blast Gauge charges 25% slower. 

Blast 1 gauges are needed to transform, go into max power mode, and do moves like solar flare, status effects and defensive barriers, etc.

- Dragon Spirit – Blast Stocks charge 25% faster. 

- Essence of Sight – Rush Rapid Movement uses no Ki. However, you deal 13% less damage with Rush/Smash Attacks. 

- Gigantic Power – Ki damage caused by guard crushing is substantially increased. 

Guard crush is when you break their defense (it looks like glass is shattering) It forces them to lose KI and this will increase the Ki lost by 2 bars. Once a character loses all of their Ki through a guard crush, they are stunned until they naturally regenerate their base Ki power. Leaving them open for attack!

- Guard Master – You become immune to Guard Crushes. 

- Indomitable Fighting Spirit – Rate of Ki recovery after a Rush Attack hits is increased substantially. 

Every time you hit someone with hand to hand combos, you naturally gain a bit of Ki. This roughly triples the amount of Ki generated from rush attacks. Each character generates a different amount of Ki, so this could work better for some characters over others.

- Ki Control – Dragon Dash Ki use is halved. However, you get Defense -1. (You take 5% more damage from all sources). 

Dragon dash is when you charge at you opponent at high speeds and are surrounded by energy.

- Kibito’s Secret Art – During a team battle, while this player is on standby, they recover more Health, Ki, and recover their Blast Gauge faster. 

Please note that this only effects THIS character, not the rest of your team. Depending on how long this character is off the field, you can reasonably expect them to enter the field with at least full Blast Stocks.

- Launch’s Support – Charge 20% faster.

Equal to Ki +1, but costs 2 points, and stacks with blue potaras. Also you earn Z-points, which are utterly useless in the League.

- Miracle Master – According to the in-game description, you are supposed to Afterimage after you are knocked down. But there seem to be conditions that have to be met before this potara works. 

The conditions required for this potara to kick in fully are still a mystery, and could be related to being fully on the ground without trying to stand up. However, if it does proc, Afterimage automatically dodges an attack by teleporting behind the opponent.

- Perfect Guard – Take no damage while Guarding. 

- Power of Rage – Gain Clash +2. This grants a large boost to Clashes. 

Clashes refer to the high speed hand to hand combat struggles that occur when two opponents rush at each other. For the most part, Clashes are a mini-game of Rock – Paper – Scissors which heavily depends on how the AI acts, and if it has a tendency to do the inputs and win a clash. This potara helps to give a large boost over other characters aren’t using a clash potara and will let you win most clashes. Even if the AI decides to not do any inputs.

Beam Struggles seem to also be effected by clash potaras, but it seems to have a much lesser effect than normal melee clashes and is more dependant on the Super type. Ultimates seem to have a higher chance to win a beam struggle as well.

- Rush Blast (2) – Rush/Energy Blasts deal 50% more damage. 

Please note, that this effect does not stack with other “Rush Blast X” potaras, or Master Blast.

- Tension Up – Passively gain 1 bar of Ki every 40 seconds. This is a lesser version of High tension. 

- Unleash Latent Power (1) – Base Ki Power goes up by 1 bar. However, your get Ki -1. (You charge 20% slower). 

Your base Ki power is the amount of bars that passively fill with Ki, and the amount of bars that fill faster than usual if you are an active charger. This also determines how many bars of Ki you enter the battle with if you are first, and don’t use Rising Fighting Spirit.

In other words if my base Ki is 3 bars, I will gain those 3 bars quickly and then Ki charging will be slower. If my base Ki is 4 that the first 4 will charge up faster, etc. etc. Androids naturally have 5 base Ki power, and will naturally charge fully. Thus, this potara can be used to attempt to turn an active charger into more of an Android.

- Vanishing Break – Vanishing Attack +1. 

Same as Dragon Homing +1 but instead of chasing after them you teleport behind them.

- Warrior Lineage – Z Burst Dash Ki use is halved. Auto-Counter Ki use is halved. 

Z Burst Dash is a second level of Dragon dash where you circle around behind your opponent at high speed (yes they do use this in the league)

- Ultimate +1 - +20% Damage to ultimates.

####  3-Point Yellow Potaras —

- Draconic Aura – Increase in power to stun opponent. This is the primary brick wall breaker. 

Most characters have a form of brick wall in Max Power Mode. This potara will allow you to break any brick wall, including the one provided by Light Body, much easier. The only brick wall effect this will not help to break is False Courage.

- Dragon Beat – You’ll regain a Blast Stock each time you use Rapid Movement to dodge a Super. 

- Dragon Power – Gain Clash +3. This grants a gigantic boost to Clashes.

Clashes refer to the high speed hand to hand combat struggles that occur when two opponents rush at each other. For the most part, Clashes are a mini-game of Rock – Paper – Scissors which heavily depends on how the AI acts, and if it has a tendency to do the inputs and win a clash. This potara helps to give a gigantic boost over other characters aren’t using a clash potara and will let you win basically every clash. Even if the AI decides to not do any inputs.

Beam Struggles seem to also be effected by clash potaras, but it seems to have a much lesser effect than normal melee clashes and is more dependant on the Super type. Ultimates seem to have a higher chance to win a beam struggle as well.

- High Tension – Passively gain 1 bar of Ki every 20 seconds. 

- Miracle Sparking – Automatically use Afterimage while in Max Power Mode. However, you get Ultimate -1 (Supers deal 13% less damage), and Max Power Mode lasts 1/2 as long. 

Theoretically, every time, or almost every time the opponent attacks while you are in Max Power mode you will teleport behind the enemy.

- Rush Blast (3) – Rush/Energy Blasts travel 2x faster, deal 50% more damage, and cost 50% less Ki. 

Please note, that this effect does not stack with other “Rush Blast X” potaras, or Master Blast.

- Secret Measures – Blast Stocks are at maximum at the start of each battle. However, your Blast Gauge charges 50% slower. 

- Sparking Plus – MAX POWER Mode lasts 50% longer. 

- Spiritual Control – Blast Stock Consumption -1.

A move that normally take 2 blast stocks take 1 etc. etc. However, this may not lower the cost below 1. All B1s will cost at least 1 blast stock, and this does not work on Transformations.

- Unleash Latent Power (2) – Base Ki Power goes up by 2 bars. However, your get Ki -2. (You charge 40% slower). 

Your base Ki power is the amount of bars that passively fill with Ki, and the amount of bars that fill faster than usual if you are an active charger. This also determines how many bars of Ki you enter the battle with if you are first, and don’t use Rising Fighting Spirit.

In other words if my base Ki is 3 bars, I will gain those 3 bars quickly and then Ki charging will be slower. If my base Ki is 4 that the first 4 will charge up faster, etc. etc. Androids naturally have 5 base Ki power, and will naturally charge fully. Thus, this potara can be used to attempt to turn an active charger into more of an Android.

#### 4-Point Yellow Potaras 

- Dragon Crush – Dragon Homing +2. 

- Dragon Dash Mastery – Dragon Dash uses no Ki at all. However, you get Defense -1 (Take 5% more damage from all sources), and you get Clash -1.

Don’t dismiss this ability. A lot of Ki energy is used up in dragon dash, and some matches can have no clashes at all.

- Emperor’s Aura (Evil) – MAX POWER Mode lasts 50% longer. Also grants a slight increase in power to stun the opponent (About half as effective as Draconic Aura). 

- Eternal Life – Gradually recover health during combat. This happens no matter what the character does. (Limited to 1 per team.)

Regenerate approximately 100 HP/second. Equates to 6,000 HP/minute. Twice the healing ability of Dende’s Healing.

- Halo-Lite(Good)/Demon Seal-Lite(Evil) – Supers use half the Ki they normally do. However, you get Attack -1 (Deal 13% less damage with all non-super moves), and your max health is reduced by 10000. This also means that scaling potaras count one less bar of HP in terms of scaling. 

Great reward if you can pay the price, and take 10,000 damage before the fight even starts.

- Style of the Strong – Max Power Mode lasts 50% longer, and gain Ultimate +2 (Ultimates deal 26% more damage.) This bonus stacks with blue potaras. (Limited to 1 per team.)

- Unleash Latent Power (3) – Base Ki Power goes up by 3 bars. However, your get Ki -3. (You charge 60% slower). 

Your base Ki power is the amount of bars that passively fill with Ki, and the amount of bars that fill faster than usual if you are an active charger. This also determines how many bars of Ki you enter the battle with if you are first, and don’t use Rising Fighting Spirit.

In other words if my base Ki is 3 bars, I will gain those 3 bars quickly and then Ki charging will be slower. If my base Ki is 4 that the first 4 will charge up faster, etc. etc. Androids naturally have 5 base Ki power, and will naturally charge fully. Thus, this potara can be used to attempt to turn an active charger into more of an Android.

- Vanishing Rush – Vanishing Attack +2. 

Again, don’t dismiss these abilities, these attacks do considerable damage.

- Broken Glow - B2's cost half price, but you have an Attack -1 and Super -1.

- Ultra Divine Water - +1 to all stats, but -1 bar of health.

#### 6-Point Yellow Potaras —

- Halo(Good)/Demon Seal(Evil) – Blast 2/Ultimate Blast Ki use is halved. However, you get Attack -1 (Deal 13% less damage with all non-super moves*).

Again, a great reward if you can pay the price. The increase to cost is due to Master Roshi’s Training being paired with it. This is the only time where Master Roshi’s training is allowed.

## Modding

Currently, DBZ League makes use of a number of mods to make the league more balanced, and to make certain characters acceptable for use in the league.

One of the most prominent mods is that all B1 healing moves have been removed, as in a previous era of the league, these needed a lot of restrictions to not be overpowered. 
The sole remaining healing B1 to this is Garlic Jr's Makyo Star, as it heals less than half the amount of other B1s. At the current time, it does not have any restrictions associated with him.

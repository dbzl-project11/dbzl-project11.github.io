## Off-season schedule


The offseason is comprised of several components:


- Testing period
- Coach tryouts
- Trading window
- Drop/add
- Seasonal Bidding

Additionally, staff will announce any rule changes or balance changes as early into the off-season as possible.

### Testing period

Teams may only test during the off-season, and will continue up through the pre-season. The testing rules can be found [here](./testing.md).

### Coach tryouts

As noted in the coach's rules, coaching is a seasonal position. As such, most coaches will be selected during the off-season.

### Trading

Trades, whether permanent or temporary, may only occur during the off-season. Rules can be found [here](./trading.md).

### Drop/add

This is the period when teams can change their base roster for the season. At this time, teams must as declare which forms 
of characters will be used, if applicable. As a side effect, a select number of unused forms may be used as Free Agents.

- For example, Cold Kingdom must declare which form Frieza and Cooler will be in at this time. 

After drop/add completes, staff will determine the free agent list and free agent costs.

### Seasonal Bidding

This is when teams will bid on their team's seasonal free agent and home map using their zeni. Team themes will be made available on a first come first serve basis.

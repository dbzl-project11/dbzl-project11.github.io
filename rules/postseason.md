## Post Season Seeding

At the end of the main season :

1. the teams with the highest win/loss record (aka the divisional champions) in each kai will receive a by for the first week of the post-season.
2. the teams with the 4 lowest W/L records  across the league will be out of the playoffs. In case the divisional winner is somehow in the bottom 4, point 1 takes precedence.
3. the divisional champions will be seeded into 4 brackets based on W/L record.  
4. The remaining 8 teams will then be seeded. For tie breaking purposes, we will first use the same tie breaker that is used to determine the kais for each season*. If there is an unresolvable tie after this, we will look at the number of divisional wins each team had in their home division.

5. order the remaining 8 teams by W/L record and seed them into each bracket as follows :

bracket 1: 1 vs 8
bracket 2: 2 vs 7
bracket 3: 3 vs 6
bracket 4: 4 vs 5

6. the 2nd playoff round will see the divisional champions face off against the winners of there respective brackets.  So :

divisional champion with the highest W/L record vs bracket 4 winner 
divisional champion with the 2nd highest W/L record vs bracket 3 winner 
divisional champion with the 3rd highest W/L record vs bracket 2 winner 
divisional champion with the 4th highest W/L record vs bracket 1 winner 

7. The semi-finals will use the following pairings:

winner of bracket 1 vs winner of bracket 4
winner of bracket 2 vs winner of bracket 3


## Seasonal Tie breakers

For the majority of teams, simply comparing win/loss records is enough to determine the seeding for the next season and the post season. However, in cases where there is a tie among teams, this is how it's resolved.

1. If it's just two teams tied, who won the match between them gets the tie breaker.
2. If it's multiple teams tied, we create an artificial division of these teams, then check the matches between these teams, and rank them as if it they were a normal division (example below)
3. If there is still an unresolvable tie, then we use the average damage of the top 5 characters on the team as the tiebreaker.

### Example

Let's say that Androids, Rugrats, Cold, and Royals are all tied at 8-7. Androids were in North Kai, Cold and Royals in East Kai, and Royals in West Kai. These would go into an artificial division.

For this example, let's say Androids beat all of Cold, Rugrats, and Royals. They would be at the top of this division. In turn, if Cold lost the matches against all 3 teams, they would be at the bottom. Then the final tie breaker would be who won between Rugrats and Royals.

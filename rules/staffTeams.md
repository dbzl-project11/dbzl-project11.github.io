With the upcoming season seeing about half of staff working on teams in some fashion,
staff is setting these rules for how to communicate while minimizing the chance for
conflicts of interest to arise. 

1. if you want advice from a staff member on builds, reach out to a staff member not on a team. 
2. If staff needs to communicate with a team, we will try to create a temp chat where staff and team members can discuss things. 
3. staff members who are on teams will not be allowed to vote on staff decisions that directly impact their teams

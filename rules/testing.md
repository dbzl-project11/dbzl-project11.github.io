## Testing

##### Rules

1. Testing is currently an off-season only activity. 

2. All testing will be in the following formats, and must follow normal build template rules (such as potara costs). All posts in the relevant discord channel must be complete test requests. Placeholders are not permitted.
    - 1v1
        - 1 test with 7 guaranteed rounds (formatted as: 1 1v1 7R)
        - 2 distinct 1v1 tests with 3 guaranteed rounds (formatted as: 2 1v1 3R)
        - 3 distinct 1v1 tests with 2 guaranteed rounds (formatted as: 3 1v1 2R)

    - 2v2
        - 1 test with 3 guaranteed rounds (formatted as: 1 2v2 3R)
        - 2 single round matches (formatted as: 2 2v2 1R)
    
    - 3v3 
        - 1 test with 2 guaranteed rounds (formatted as 1 3v3 2R)
    - 4v4 
        - 1 elimination round (formatted as: 1 4v4 1R)
        - Once a week.
        - These requests do not stack, use it or lose it.
        - 4v4 requests must be submitted by Thursday 11:59pm CST. 

3. All tests may have a full 7 point build with the following caveats. 

    - Team potara limitations do not apply. For example, in a 4 v4, you can have Dende's Healing on each member of your team.
    - Unless specifically requested, you will be testing on your current home map.

4. Once Base rosters have been decided, you may only test the forms declared *or* higher forms. Lower form testing is not permitted after that.

   - Example: If Androids declare they're using Semi-Perfect Cell, they can test Semi-Perfect, Perfect, and Super Perfect. They may not test Imperfect Cell.

## Zeni


Zeni is the currency teams use each season to purchase various things such as boosts from the boost store, free agents for a season, 
and to bid on music and maps. 

Teams earn zeni during the main season matches: 1 zeni for a win, and 2 for a loss. 

After each season, teams will earn a set amount of zeni based on the total number of losses and on how far they made it into the post season. 
In general, the formula is as follows:

12 + (# of losses / 2  rounded down) if > 10 wins <br />
12 + (# of losses if < 10 losses/wins)<br />
12 + (# of losses but all loses past 9 give 2 zeni) <br />

Additional Zeni for Playoff Placement:<br />
Champs = 0 Zeni<br />
Finalists = 1 Zeni<br />
Semi-Finalists = 2 Zeni<br />
Quarter-Finalists = 3 Zeni<br />
Round 1 Knockout = 4 Zeni<br />
Out-of-Playoffs = 5 Zeni<br />

## Potara Rules and Restrictions

Generally speaking, we follow the same rules as the main league. The legal potaras can be found here.

A core change is that all characters will have a free Master Roshi's Training potara for an extra bar of health. This means you can only have 6 potaras in a given build.

#### ToP Specific changes

* These potaras also fall under the "one per team" limitation (in addition to what the main league restricts)
    * Style of the Strong
    * Savior
    
* Healing changes
    * If you have 2 Dende's Healing, you may not use Eternal Life
    * If you use Eternal Life, you may not use Dende's Healing

#### Potara cost changes

The biggest change is that for the purposes of the ToP, a number of potaras have had their costs adjusted.

## ToP Structure

What is the Tournaments Structure?
* This event has 2 tournaments. The Preliminaries and the Tournament of Power(play offs)

Preliminaries
* Will be a Swiss Tournament to help with the seeding of the Tournament of Power(playoffs)
* This is a non elimination format that as each round goes on will change who you are up against

Round 1: Completely random

Round 2:
* 1-0 teams will face another 1-0 team
* 0-1 teams will face another 0-1 Team

Round 3:
* 2-0 vs 2-0
* 1-1 vs 1-1
* 0-2 vs 0-2

Round 4:
* 3-0 vs 3-0
* 2-1 vs 2-1
* 1-2 vs 1-2
* 0-3 vs 0-3

Your points will then average out between your W/L record which will help decide seeding
* 4-0 team = 4 points
* 3-1 teams = 2 points
* 2-2 teams = 0 points
* 1-3 teams = -2 points
* 0-4 team = -4 points

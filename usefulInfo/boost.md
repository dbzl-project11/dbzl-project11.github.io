## Boost Store

Each season, teams earn zeni based on their win loss record of the previous season. Additionally, teams earn 1 zenni per 
win or 2 zenni per loss during the main season.

This zenni can be used to purchase a number of different bonuses for your team during main season matches.

#### Free Potaras

These are limited to one per player per match and wouldn't count towards your 7 points for that character. These are all 
one-time use, and the same one cannot be used on the same character two weeks in a row. For instance, if Jeice has 
Super +3 (Super +2 Ki-1, and Super +1) one week, he cannot have a free Super +1 the next. This rule is in place to prevent 
teams from using the same boost multiple times in a row. 

Note - this does not for you to have duplicate potaras on a build. In cases where you want to use a +1 potara on a build, 
and the same +1 potara as a boost on that same character, the corresponding +2 potara will be used. 

Please remember that this does take up one of your 7 customization slots, and potara rules for characters are still in effect. 
The store does not allow you to put potaras on characters that are not allowed to use them. However, these free potaras will 
bypass potara limits. For instance, if you have Dragon Power on Krillin and Yamcha, you may use the Dragon Power boost on 
Chiaotzu and Goku so that everyone has Dragon Power that week. Note that purchasing lower versions of a potara does not 
cause them to stack. For instance, Power of Rage + Unleashed Ki =/= Dragon Power. The game always prioritizes the higher 
boost.

#### Other boosts

  
- Immediately "rotate" your free agent regardless of what week it is - 2 Zenni
    - This boost would also enable you to trade out someone who was already rotated out as if it was a week where you could do so normally. For example, if you are the Earth's Defenders, and you have Mid Vegeta (Your free agent), Goku, Tien, Krillin, and Yamcha in as fighters and Chiaotzu swapped out. You may choose to use this boost to swap Krillin out and Chiaotzu in as fighters.

The weeks you normally rotate your free agent bench are the following:

    Week 1 (meaning you can start the season with whatever Free Agent you wish)
    Week 6
    Week 11

- Remove a limiter! (Only usable once in a season) - 10 Zenni
    - This boost enables you to remove a "Limiter ring" on one of your players. This is more of a safety feature in case things aren't going right, and you wish for that character to transform once again. Please note, that once you remove a limiter, you may not put another one on a seperate character. Once a Limiter is used, or removed, there is no reversing that decision. So please, use this boost wisely.

- Trade out a map (Only available if you are playing at home) - 2 Zenni
    - This boost would allow you to pull the rug out from under your opponent and swap to a completely different map. If you choose to use this, you may ONLY choose maps from the list provided below. Meaning you cannot use this boost to change your map to mountain road or the tournament stage, since they are unavailable and reserved for the Gauntlet and Playoffs respectively.

Available maps for the map trade boost:

    The Wastelands
    Rocky Area
    City Ruins
    The Islands
    The Desert
    The Glaciers
    King's Castle
    Muscle Tower
    Kame House
    Penguin Village
    Mt. Paozu
    The Room of Spirit and Time (AKA the Hyperbolic Time Chamber)
    Supreme Kai's world
    Hell
    Planet Namek (Normal)
    Planet Namek (Destroyed)
    Broly's Planet

Please note, that these boosts are designed to only be used during the season. You cannot use any of these boosts during the playoffs. Please make sure to "purchase" boosts at the top of your builds to avoid confusion.
